# Assignment 4: Gomoku AI with Monte Carlo Tree Search
Course: CSE 150B – Artificial Intelligence for Games  
Status: 🔒 Code not published due to academic integrity policy

## 🧠 What I Did
- Implemented an AI for Gomoku using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**
- MCTS returns not only the best move but also a **table of estimated win rates** per action
- AI was tested with:
  - Predefined game states
  - Self-play against a random AI agent

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Python 3.10
- PyGame
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (UCB1, Selection, Expansion, Simulation, Backpropagation)
